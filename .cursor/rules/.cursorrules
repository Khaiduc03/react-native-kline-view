// Cursor project rules for react-native-kline-view

// General

- preferTypescript: true
- inferTypesFromUsage: true

// File conventions

- treat `example/App.tsx` and all files in `example/components/*.tsx` as the primary React Native UI entry points.
- new React components should be written in `.tsx` with typed props instead of `.js`.
- when touching a `.js` file in `example/utils/`, prefer incremental migration to `.ts` (keep runtime behavior identical).

// React / hooks

- follow React hook rules strictly; keep `useState`/`useEffect`/`useCallback` dependencies correct rather than disabling lint rules.
- avoid creating new inline functions in JSX where a memoized `useCallback` handler is reasonable.

// Styling & layout

- reuse existing style factories like `createToolbarStyles`, `createControlBarStyles`, `createSelectorsStyles` when adding new UI.
- keep chart container layout compatible with the current Binance-like design (header + stats + chart card + controls).

// Native bridge

- do not change public API of `react-native-kline-view` (props, optionList shape, imperative methods) without confirming the change is backward compatible.
- any changes to iOS native files under `ios/Classes` must keep method signatures used by `RNKLineView.m` and JS wrapper.

// Lint / formatting

- respect `.eslintrc.js` and Prettier settings; do not disable rules globally to "fix" lint errors.
- fix new TypeScript errors introduced by edits, but avoid large refactors unless explicitly requested.
